# SMPOnline CobblePlus Datapack

*Created by Bittorn / cadeautje*

## What does this do?

Add badges from Pixelmon into a datapack. Also popcorn.

## Usage

A stack of any badge can be spawned with `/function cobplus:badges/<badge_name> {sign=<player_name>}`
`<player_name>` is the name of the player given on the metadata.
E.g. `/function cobplus:badges/cobble_badge {sign="nobody"}`
will give a Cobble Badge with the lore `This badge has been signed by nobody`

Symbols can be crafted by placing iron/gold nuggets in a stonecutter to produce iron/gold symbols.

A stack of popcorn can be spawned with `/function cobplus:popcorn` or crafted by combining a Sweet Berry with a Yellow Apricorn.

For players who beat 100% of the game (or whatever other reward you want), a 'gift' can be spawned with `/function cobplus:gift`

## Requirements

- The SMPOnline CobblePlus resource pack
- Cobblemon

## Credits

All symbol and badge textures were created by the Pixelmon team, excepting custom badges (which I did). 32x32 badges were manually downscaled and cleaned up by me.

Popcorn texture based off of a random image I found on the internet (credit that guy)

'Gift' was created with the assistance of style transfer AI, with manual touchups done after the fact.
